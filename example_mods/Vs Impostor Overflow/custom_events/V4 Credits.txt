If you want the credits to show up again
Replace the two lines of the credits. Insert ";" to
seperate a value.
Value 1: "Song Name;Composer: Name"
Example: "Bopeebo;Composer: Kawai Sprite"

Value 2: "objWidth;objHeight" (objHeight is Optional)
Change the size of the credits box.
Example: "250;87" or "250"
